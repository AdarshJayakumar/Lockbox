									</header>
									<p> Our final project for ECE 4760: Digital Systems Design Using Microcontrollers is an ultra-secure programmable lockbox. The box can be unlocked using a keypad, three tunable knobs, a 'knocking' pattern (through a piezo electric sensor), and a fingerprint sensor. The user must provide the proper inputs to each of the various systems using the directions displayed on a TFT LCD screen. Once the box is unlocked, the user may update the passwords, combinations, and fingerprints that must be provided to unlock the box again. <br/><br/>This lockbox is a highly marketable product which provides real security in a unique way. In particular, this product may appeal to younger children who would like to have a toy box that no one but themselves can unlock. In addition, this box is equipped with a lot of nuanced programmable hardware which may perk the interest of those interested in DIY electronics. </p>

										<h4>Details</h4>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/lockbox_front.jpg" width=400px alt="" /><i>Figure 1: Initial Design Idea</i></span>The lockbox comes installed with factory settings. That is, the keypad passoword, potentiometer knob combination, knocking pattern, and fingerprint are preset. The factory settings are as follows: the password is set to 1-2-3-4, the tunable potentiometer knobs are set to unlock at a decimal value of 350, with a 30 value threshold above or below, the knock pattern is set to a knock, pause, knock, knock; finally, the user sends in a fingerprint, or a set of fingerprints, when ordering the box for ultimate security.  Upon retrieving the box, the user unlocks it for the first time and them can reset the four digit password, the unlocking values of each potentiometer, and the knocking pattern.</p>

The code and hardware was done in such a manner that the user must go through in this way.

                                    <h4>Hardware/Software Trade-offs</h4>
                                        <p>In terms of trade-offs between hardware and software, a multiplexer (mux) was used between the potentiometers and piezo sensor for knocking. A mux was determined to be necessary because using only one internal ADC on the PIC32 was used, instead of multiple different ADCs for each potentiometer as well as the piezo speaker.

									<h3>Analog Circuitry</h3>
									<p>A large portion of the project was devoted to building and testing standard analog circuitry for each portion of the lockbox. The schematics for these are included below.</p>

												<h4>Potentiometer and Piezo</h4>
												<p>The potentiometer and piezo circuitry was accomplished through the addition of an analog multiplexer. This multiplexer was used in order to simplify the code necessary for the potentiometers and piezo-electric sensor by reducing the amount of adc ports running from four to one. The three potentiometers acted as tunable knobs for the user to set and unlock the box, similar to a classic safe. Each potentiometer had one end terminal connected to Vdd (3.3 Volts) and the other end terminal conected to ground. The wiper of each potentiometer was connected through a 330 Ohm resistor to the first three inputs of the multiplexer. Meanwhile, the piezo electric sensor acted as another safety mechanism for the box. The negative terminal of the piezo electric sensor was connected to ground. The positive terminal of the piezo electric was connected to the fourth input of the multiplexer in parallel with a 1 Megaohm resistor to ground. The multiplexer was powered through Vdd (3.3 Volts) with its INH, Vee, and Vss terminals all tied to ground. Because only four inputs were required, select signal 'C' was also grounded. Select signals 'A' and 'B' were connected to digital pins of the microcontroller (pins 14 and 26 respectively) with the output of the mux connected to an analog pin (pin 24).  </p>

												<h4>Solenoid Valve </h4>
												<p>A 12 volt solenoid circuit was used to drive the valve high and low based upon the voltage from a microcontroller digital output pin. The basis of this circuit was taken from Bruce Land’s ECE 4760 Lab 4 project page (Link here). The circuit acts as a first order low-pass filter when the valve is off and a second-order low-pass filter when the valve is on. In order to safeguard all components and the MCU from any inductive spikes of the valve, a 4N35 opto-isolator was utilized to separate ‘valve ground’ and ‘MCU ground’. The BUZ73 FET sets the voltage of the valve based on the signal generated from the opto-isolator transistor. A 1 MΩ resistor was placed at the base of the opto-isolator’s transistor in order to optimize the fall time of the solenoid. In addition, a 100 nF capacitor was placed in parallel with the valve in order to filter noise from the input to the valve. Finally, the FET was protected from inductive spikes through the flyback diode in parallel with the valve. This flyback diode essentially cycles energy back to the power source and back through the valve instead of the transistor when the valve is transitioning from a high to low state.</p>

												<h4>Keypad and TFT</h4>
												<p> The keypad used for entering an unlocking code was the same used in Lab 2 in the creations of the DTMF dialer.  It used seven pins on the PIC32, with rows 1-4 taking up pins 2, 3, 9, and 10 on the PIC32, and columns 1-3 taking up pins 16-18 on the PIC32 microcontroller.  The keypad uses 10 kiloOhm pull-down resistors on each column to provide a viable path to ground from the column pins, and uses 300 Ohm resistors on the rows to provide a viable path to ground from the row pins. Each switch connects a row wire to a column wire. 
                                                
                                                The TFT LCD screen was used to interact with the user as they unlock the box. The connections to the screen itself takes pins 4, 5, 6, 22, and 25 on the PIC32 microcontroller.  As the user goes through each step to unlock the box, the TFT displays information such as the unlocking step, or is used for feedback of information such as potentiometer values or the current passcode being entered.

												<h4>Fingerprint Scanner</h4>
												<p> The fingerprint scanner was connected to the PIC32 through an external connection through an Arduino microcontroller. The fingerprint scanner was connected via a 4-pin JST terminal with connections to VDD, ground, RX, and TX (pins 4, 5 on the Arduino). The Arduino was used due to the fact that there is public source code, linked <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sparkfun/Fingerprint_Scanner-TTL/master/FPS_GT511C3/Examples/FPS_IDFinger/FPS_IDFinger.ino">here</a>.  The Arduino communicated with the PIC32 by outputting a 5V signal from pin 12 to the PIC microstick whenever a correct fingerprint was detected. In addition to sending a signal to the PIC32, a signal was sent to the solenoid valve to unlock the box, as the fingerprint scanner is the final security measure.

												<h4>Power</h4>
												<p> <a <span class="image right"><img src="images/back_of_box.jpg" width=400px alt="" />
                                                <i>Figure 6: Back of Lockbox</i></a>There were three separate voltage rails that needed to be supplied for this product: 12 Volts for the Solenoid valve, 5 volts for the Arduino and 3.3 Volts for the PIC32, multiplexer, and solenoid circuit. We used a 12 Volt AC-DC wall adapter and two linear regulators in order to provide all of these power rails. The wall adapter plugged into a barrel jack on the back of the box which went straight to the 12 volt rail for the solenoid valve. 

                                                A LM340 5 Volt LDO regulator and MCP1702 3.3 Volt LDO regulator were supplied with 12 volts and produced 5 volts and 3.3 volts respectively. Each of these regulators contained two 100 nF capacitors (one from input to ground and another from output to ground) in order to reduce transient voltage fluctuations caused by rapid changes in load current. The grounds for the 5 volt and 3.3 volt rails were shorted together (in order to create a common ground) and optically isolated from the 12 volt rail ground. A final 100 nF capacitor was placed between the positive and negative 12 volt rails in order to prevent transient voltage spikes whenever the solenoid valve was triggered.

									<h4>Keypad</h4>
									<p>This thread contains the finite state machine (FSM) that debounces the button, the code which stores key presses into a buffer and triggers playback of said buffer, and the triggering of the voice as each button is pressed.  The finite state machine, as described in class, can be found below:
                                                The finite state machine begins in the ‘Release’ state by checking to see if the keycode is equal to -1. It does this by spawning the scanKey thread, which polls for key presses, by using the PT_SPAWN() function.  The thread then yields for 30 milliseconds using PT_YIELD_TIME_msec(30). If keycode is equal to -1, that means no button has been pressed and we return back to the ‘Release’ state through the ‘Yes’ transition. If keycode is not equal to -1, we go through the ‘No’ transition to the ‘MaybePush’ state, storing our value of keycode into a new variable possible along the way. Within the ‘MaybePush’ state, we check to see if keycode is equal to possible, meaning that nothing has changed and the button press seems to be stable. If the answer is ‘No’, we go back to our ‘Release’ state and call our scanKey thread. If the answer is ‘Yes’, the most important portion of the FSM occurs. In the transition from the MaybePushed to the ‘Pushed’ state, the digits are stored (as the possible values), and voice/DTMF playback occurs depending on which button has been pressed. Using the keycode variable set in the scanKey thread, and a separate counter variable, buf_count, valid key presses (i.e. keys zero through nine) are placed inside a buffer called key_buf, which supports a maximum of twelve digits.  While the key press is being placed in the buffer, PT_SPAWN is being used to call the setVoice thread, which sets the starting and ending indices of the proper number, as described in the pt_setVoice portion. This triggers the voice to be spoken out of the DAC via the ISR.  If the key pressed is not a valid number, then the digit is not added to the buffer.  The thread then continues to check the pound_key and restart_key flags.  


Within the ‘Pushed’ state, we once again check if keycode is equal to possible. If the answer is ‘Yes’, we call our scankey thread and feedback into our ‘Pushed’ state. If the answer is ‘No’, we enter into the ‘MaybeNoPush’ state. Within the ‘MaybeNoPush’ state, we check if keycode is equal to possible. If the answer is ‘Yes’, we must check if our keypad is properly debounced by returning to our ‘Pushed’ state and calling the scankey thread. If the answer is ‘No’, we simply return back to the ‘Release’ state and call our scankey thread.
                                    </p>
                                    <h4>Potentiometers</h4>
                                    <p>We use ADC to continously read the outputs of the three potentiometers. We then map these values from (0,1024) to (100,999) using a simple linear mapping. We do this so that the user can only input 3-digit potentiometer values. We display this value on the screen so that the user can observe the values being input to the screen. If the potentiometers are within 20 of the locking value, the stage is passed, and the code moves on to the piezo thread to detect knocking. A threshold value was used due to the instability of the potentiometers in terms of staying on one value for the time needed to unlock the stage.

The box itself was quite small, so planning needed to be done to make the final product usable. The fingerprint scanner was placed in the bottom left of the box, with the keypad above it, and the TFT screen propped up on the right. When each individual component of the box was moved from the testing phase onto the box, the breadboards were substituted for perfboards to make the circuitry cleaner and less-space consuming. The perfboards, PIC32 microstick, and the Arduino were all placed inside the box itself.

								<h3>Conclusions</h3>
								
								<h5>Standards</h5>
								<p>There are no known standards relevent to our project. </p>
								<h5>Intellectual Property Considerations</h5>
								<p>While working on this project, we drew extensively from work we had previously done in the course. In particular, we used the keycode state machine implemented in lab 2. We also went back to our code in lab 3 to reacquaint ourselves with the ADC software setup. We did not, however, take any designs or code from other sources into consideration and thus we did not deal with any patent or trademark issues.<br/><br/> We look forward to working towards publishing our work next semester.</p>
